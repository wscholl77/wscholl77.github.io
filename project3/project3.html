    <h2>The importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience.</h2>
    <h3>Responsive web design (RWD) is important so the website can be designed once and effectively reach any person regardless of the device theyâ€™re using. Worldwide, as of October 2016 according to Statcounter, mobile is being used more than desktop computers to access websites. Even in North America, around 50% of users access websites via a mobile phone or tablet. If the website target audience overlaps with the mobile/tablet target audience, then RWD becomes very important to create a positive user experience.</h3>

      <h2>Three kinds of Google Analytics reports that gives information on what target audience is accessing.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Users Flow: This will show you a graph of how users are navigating their way through your website. It will show you the source of how the user landed on your page and allow you to compare volumes from the different sources. You can select a dimension (city, device, medium), add a segment (social traffic, loyal traffic), and then analyze that specific group. You can examine the patterns of your users and determine how effective your website is.</li>
      <li>Active Users: This report could show you how many users are on your website at that very moment. You can also see the number of users who visited your website in the last 1, 7, 14 and 30-day periods. You can apply advanced segments like direct traffic or organic traffic. This can be helpful to determine if you are encouraging users to return to your site.</li>
      <li>Demographics and Interests: You can analyze your users by age, gender and interest categories when running this report. This allows you through 3 sub-reports to see what else the people who are interested in your products and services do online. The affinity report shows the general interests of users, in-market segments indicate ones showing purchase intent and the other report just shows what else they are browsing.</li>
