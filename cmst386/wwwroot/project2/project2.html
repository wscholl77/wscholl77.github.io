    <h1>Project 2: Website Proposal</h1>
    <h2>1. Client and Topic</h2>
    <h3>I’ll be creating a website for a local ministry called Bearing Precious Seed Milford. They have a worldwide impact in their printing of and sending out Bibles. Their current website is bpsmilford.org.</h3>
    <h2>2. Development Process and Engagement</h2>
    <h3>I’ll be developing this website for the client Bearing Precious Seed of Milford. I’ll be using their current site bpsmilford.org as a guideline to pull content only. There should be sufficient information on the current website, if not I will reach out to them directly. They will be presented with versions along the way to approve or make changes.</h3>
    <h2>3. Testing</h2>
    <h3>First Baptist of Milford is a large church with many missionaries, preachers, teachers, and seasoned Christians.
      I can consult with and show the website to several different individuals to be sure it aligns with the mission and ideals of the ministry.
      They can also be a resource for new ideas, current trends, and current ideologies of the missionary and Bible distributing world.
      Along the way I’m mainly testing the website in Google Chrome but will also test in Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

      <u>Specifically, on the website itself, I will be asking the following questions when evaluating the content and design:
        <ul>
          <li>Home: Is the ministry summarized in a concise way? Is there a way to link to every other page on the website?</li>
          <li>History: Is the appropriate picture being painted of the origins of BPS, the key people involved, the technical challenges overcame, the nature of the Bible publishing industry, and the change in production and efficiency over the years?
              Are pictures provided of the various printers used through the years?</li>
          <li>Staff: Are the key individuals and their job title in the organization identified and pictured?</li>
          <li>Production: Is the productivity of printing bibles quantified by year and decade? Is it easy to see the growth patterns immediately?</li>
          <li>Seedline/El Paso/FirstBible: Are these ministries summarized in a concise way? Are the users able to link to the respective websites of these organizations?</li>
          <li>Newsletter: Can the current quarter’s newsletter be viewed and downloaded?</li>
          <li>Contact: Is there a form that can be used to collect contact information to subscribe individuals to the newsletter?
              Is there a way to determine how the user found BPS? Will all the pertinent contact information for BPS be provided?</li>
        </ul></u>

    </h3>
    <h2>4. Description</h2>
    <h3>Bearing Precious Seed is a Scripture publishing ministry of First Baptist Church in Milford, OH.
        BPS prints Scriptures and Scripture portions and distributes them to churches and missionaries all around the world.
        The website is designed to give information about the ministry and to provide a means of contact.

        <u> In general, the target audience would be Christians.
            This may specifically include Baptists as the founding church of BPS is Evangelical Baptist.
            According to Pew Research, 85% in this group are white and the age range has 85% over age 30 and 55% over age 50.
            These are very conservative families and senior citizens.
            Leadership and staff at churches would likely be on the website to find information on Seedline.
            Missionaries to other countries would be interested in requesting Bibles for the country they are being sent to.
            Individuals or families that are seeking volunteer opportunities would be another possible audience.
            Understanding the target audience is important so the pages will be designed in a way that connects with them visually and motivates them to be involved.
            They should understand the vision of BPS and what they might do to further it.
            These considerations will assist in determining the appropriate content.
            The website should mainly be accessed on desktop PCs, but consideration should also be given to other devices like mobile and tablet.
            Identifying this target audience may call for a conservative design and attention to a pure message that’s communicated.
            It should be very easy to use the website to reach out to BPS, whether through the web page, email, phone or by personal visit.
            All this information should be provided and easily found as soon as the user enters the website.</u>


        This website will not have especially unique content. Most of the content will come from the current website but the Seedline and El Paso pages will come from their respective websites. The privacy page will be generated by a privacy policy generator.</h3>
    <h2>5. Growth and Maintenance</h2>
    <h3>The ministry is conservative and has not grown in dramatic ways over time. As such, the website will keep pace and develop slowly. The ministry is focused on its main objective of printing Bibles so the website will only be a tool to facilitate that cause. The website will require very little maintenance. All the content should be reviewed at least monthly to be sure it’s up to date. The newsletter just needs to be updated twice a year.</h3>
    <h2>6. Organization</h2>
    <h3>The website will be organized in a hierarchical structure. The Home Page will link out to 4 main pages: About, Ministries, Newsletter and Contact. The About page will link to History and Staff. The Ministries page will link to Seedline and El Paso. The Newsletter and Contact pages will stand alone. The privacy policy will be linked from the footer of each page. There will be a Homepage, privacy page, 4 main pages and 4 sub-pages for a total of 10 pages. Each page will have a large hero image that initially may seem to dominate the page but there will be more content as the user scrolls down. The navigation bar will be on the left-hand side and will have dropdowns for the sub-pages. There will be a footer with a few items in that section. The main body of each page will be comprised of text and images. A color contrast analyzer will be used to ensure the colors and fonts meet a minimum ratio of 4.5:1. The contact page will have an accessible form to sign up for the newsletter.</h3>
    <h2>7. Security</h2>

    <h3>The website will not have an e-commerce component, password protection or the need for users to create accounts.
        As such, there will not be a compelling reason to expend extra resources securing the website.
        The content will just need to be crafted carefully to not show any sensitive or confidential information.

        <u>The form on the contact page will be used to collect personal information and a privacy policy will be linked in the footer of every page.
        The main purpose of the form is to allow individuals to subscribe to the quarterly newsletter.
        It will also be a way to send a message to BPS by using the comment section.
        The name and email fields will be required, and all other fields will be optional.
        It will ask how the person heard about BPS.
        It will also ask if the user would like to be contacted and if so, by what medium.</u>
      </h3>

    <h2>8. Web Hosting</h2>
    <h3>The hosting company should have an uptime score above 99.5% to help stabilize viewership and lead to better search engine ratings. The quality of customer service and ability to chat with them also makes a difference for me personally. I appreciate transparent pricing and honest recommendations for what services I might need. I’m not sure if all hosting services have this but it’s nice to have a built-in file manager to eliminate the need for FileZilla. It’s important that the site should always appear secure and messages not pop up that say otherwise. An SSL certificate would help with that and help boost Google rankings. This website will have HTML, CSS and JavaScript that will need to be supported. The domain name has already been chosen of bpsmilford.org.</h3>
    <h2>9. Marketing</h2>
    <h3>The website will be mainly marketed through the missionaries and BPS staff as they present the ministry. Search Engine Optimization will also be utilized to create traffic and be accessible from Google and other search engines. Each page will have a title tag. The keyword, description, copyright, author, and robots meta tags will be implemented. An XML sitemap will be generated. A search function and favicon will also be added.</h3>
