    <h1>Project 2 Reflection</h1>
    <h2>1. What applications did you use to complete the wireframes? Did you find the application simple to use or find an alternative to what was suggested?</h2>
    <h3>I used framebox.org and found it very easy to use and simple. I loved how user friendly it was. One issue was that I couldn’t figure out how to copy the whole design of the Homepage to use as a framework for the About page. This made it awkward to try and recreate the exact sizes and proportions so the two sites would have continuity.</h3>
    <h2>2. Explain what you learned when building the flowchart diagram in the proposal? Did you use one of the listed applications to diagram the site? If not, what did you use and why?</h2>
    <h3>Initially I used draw.io but scrapped it. I was able to design the flow chart ok, but the issue came when trying to link, embed or show it on the website. Since I enjoyed using Framebox so much for the wireframes, I decided to use it for the flowchart. It wasn’t perfect for flowchart purposes, but it gets the message across. It was also very easy to link from my webpage. I also used the snipping tool to create an image, which I scaled down using GIMP and then created a thumbnail at the bottom of the Project 2 page. I also added dropdowns for the wireframes, flowchart and reflection just for fun and to have more options on the menu.</h3>
    <h2>3. What challenges did you face in developing the main navigation for the final project? How did you resolve them?</h2>
    <h3>I found it a bit difficult to even get started on the proposal. It took several sittings to finally piece together a plan. It just seems so overwhelming at first, but I would work on it in 30-60 minute chunks until my brain was tired, then try again the next day. I found it helpful to pull up some other ministry websites and review their design. This helped give me the confidence to start putting together the pieces. It was challenging to determine which pages would be included in the 10. I started out with more than 10 and then whittled them away as I read and re-read the project 4 guidelines. Some of the pages weren’t appropriate to try and incorporate into the project.</h3>
