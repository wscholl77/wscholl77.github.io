UMGC has partnered with my employer Amazon.com to offer Associates Degrees in certain high demand occupations. They pay 95% of the costs so it’s a good opportunity to take advantage of. I have a BA from the University of Cincinnati in Organizational Leadership but am very interested in learning about Web Development. I’ve been out of school for 4 years and really miss the challenge of the process. I overcame a lot of bad habits and flawed thinking through the process of getting my Bachelors. I hope to use those skills that I learned to work through this process. I’m single with no kids so family-wise my support system is my mom, dad and younger sister who all live within 10 minutes. I also have an older brother and sister who live further away. My family supports me by having people to always be able to call and spend time with. I also have support from people at my church and job. I’m sure I’ll need to refresh my memory on things like writing papers, citing sources and using the library. I’m pretty comfortable writing papers but I could always use another set of eyes from the writing center. I want to get even more comfortable in the computer and online environment so I’m able to use those skills to further my career or freelance. 





In this course, we will express our ideas, share what we’ve learned, and provide feedback to our fellow classmates by participating in discussions. The discussions provide a forum for us to interact with each other, as well as to make connections and build relationships that may endure throughout your academic journey and beyond. 
University of Maryland Global Campus operates under a code of civility that requires respect, kindness, and nondiscrimination in all interactions. Keep the code of civility in mind as you participate in the course discussions.
